**AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**  
AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.  
AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes.  
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.  

**Servlet**  
A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model.  
Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers.  

**JSP**  
Jakarta Server Pages is a collection of technologies that helps software developers to create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, SOAP, or other document types.  

**GWT**  
Google Web Toolkit is an open-source set of tools that allows web developers to create and maintain JavaScript front-end applications in Java.  
GWT provides generic HTTP classes that you can use to build the request, and JSON and XML client classes that you can use to process the response.  
You can also use overlay types to convert JavaScript objects into Java objects that you can interact with in your IDE while developing.  

One of the benefits of using GWT is that you can leverage the tools, such as refactoring, code completion, and debugging, available in a Java IDE.  

**EJB**  
Enterprise java beans(EJB) is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic of an application.  
EJB consists of 3 parts Session Bean , Message Driven Bean , Entity Bean and utility components.  
Entity bean is the entity structure like an object or table in the database.  
Session bean is the service structure that has the bussiness logic in it.  
Message Driven Bean  allows applications to process messages asynchronously. This type of bean normally acts as a JMS message listener.  

**SOAP**  
Simple Object Access Protocol is a protocol used to interchange data between applications which are built on different programming languages.  
SOAP uses XML and works on HTTP methods.

SOAP does not return human readable result, has own security, slower and requires more bandwith than REST.  

**Docker**  
Docker is an application build and deployment tool that works as a containerization platform.  
Container is a package of code with dependencies fitted into a deployable unit.  
Containers works on your os as seperate threads.  
Containers are stored in a repository as images, this gives you an opportunity to download and use software without installing it directly on your computer.  

**Kafka**  
Kafka is a distributed event streaming software used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that adapt to the data streams.  
Kafka combines messaging, storage, and stream processing to allow storage and analysis of both historical and real-time data.  

**JIRA**
