# JWT JSON Web Token
It provides a secure connection between peers.  

You can use three things to make something safe:  

1. Something you have, for example a credit card, mobile phone.  
2. Something you know, for example a password, security question.  
3. Something you are, for example fingerprint, dna, face-scan.  

**vantages of JWT Token**
Since JWTs are stateless, there is no need to query the database to obtain user states.
Session management can be done without using cookies.
A single key can be used on multiple backends.
It is high performance because it does not require database query or file system usage.
**Disadvantages**  
If the JWT key is not strong enough, it will be easly break.
