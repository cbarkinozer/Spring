**SDLC**  
Software Developement Life cycle is a process used for design, develope,test high quality software products.  
SLDC aims to create software that meets customer expectation and, estimate cost and time.  
SDLC consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software.  
Some of the stages of SDLC : Planning> Defining > Designing > Building > Testing > Deployment.  

**Planning and Requirement Analysis**    
It is the fundamental stage of SDLC.  
By analyzing the needs, planning is done by selecting technologies and approaches to create highest quality software with minimum risk.    

**Defining Requirements**  
In this step the product is clearly defined and documented.  
This is done through Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed.    

**Designing The Product Architecture**  
Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and,
documented in a Design Document Specification(DDS).  

This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness,
design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.  

**Building or Developing the Product**  
The software is generated as per DDS during this stage.  
Coding guideliness are followed by teams that are working on the project.  

**Testing the Product**  
The testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC.  
This stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested,
until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.  

**Deployment**  
Once the product is ready to be deployed it is released.  
Sometimes product released by stages or released in a limited segment and tested in real but limited environment (e.g beta testing).  

Then based on the feedback, the product may be get suggested enhancements.  
After the release, maintenance (enhancing or fixing by changes) is done for the existing customer base.  

**SDLC Models**  
Some of the most popular sdlc models: Waterfall, iterative, spiral, v-model, bigbang, agile, RAD.  

**Waterfall**  
Step by step applying software developement stages.  
Suitable when:  
- Requirements are well documented and fixed  
- Product definition is stable  
- Project is small  

Advantages  
Simple, easy apply, easy to manage, well documented, phases are completed at a time.   

Disadvantages  
- Working software is only produced at the end
- High risk and uncertainty
- Not suitable for complex and oop projects
- Difficult to measure progress
- Very static

**Iterative**  
Dividing the project to multiple smaller waterfalls.  

Suitable when:
- Requirements are clear
- Major requirements defined but some changes might happen
- Time constraint
- Tech is still learned by developers

Advantages  
- Better risk analysis  
- Less rigid  
- Results are obtained earlier  

Disadvantages
- Increased resources  
- Not very suitable for change  
- More management attention  
- Project success is dependent to the risk analysis

**Spiral**  
Combination of waterfall with iterative approach.  
The time spent on the each iteration increases like a spiral from inside to outside.  
Good for budget constraint, bigger team, bigger projects.  
Usually preferred when customer is not sure the requirements.  
Risk is medium to high.  

**V-Model**  
Testing of all kinds often, at the every stage.  
Suitable for smaller and shorter, high risk projects.  

**BigBang**  
Time + resource -> work -> result
There is no sdlc plan.  
Good for academic, student projects for 1-2 developer projects.  
Too risky, cost can be too high, project end is unknown.  

**Agile**  
Agile focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product.  
The tasks are divided to time boxes (small time frames) to deliver specific features for a release.  

Needs strong teamwork and cross training.  
Requirements, documentations are minimum.  
Suitable for fastly changing requirements.  

Highly depends on customer directions.  
Minimum documentation, high individual dependency.  
Shorter deadliness, race with time.  
Higher risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.  

**RAD(Rapid Application Developement)**  
Based on prototyping and iterative development with no specific planning involved.  
Should be used only when a system can be modularized to be delivered in an incremental manner.  
Inapplicable to cheaper projects as cost of Modelling and automated code generation is very high.  
Requires domain experts.  

**Kanban**  
Kanban is a Japanese word means visual card.  
Aims freeing resources and time.  

Core concepts of Kanban
- Visualize workflow(create columns that has names and works on that columns).
- Limit work amount in progress(WIP).
- Measure the lead time(average time to complete one item).  

Benefits of Kanban  

- Bottlenecks become clear.
This leads people to collaborate and optimize the whole work chain rather than just their part.  

- Useful where operations and support teams have a high rate of uncertainty and variability.  

- Reduces inventory in the range of 25%-75%, hence reduce company costs.  

- Reduce the wait time and ensure the speed.   

- Overproduction is avoided.
