**SDLC**  
Software Developement Life cycle is a process used for design, develope,test high quality software products.  
SLDC aims to create software that meets customer expectation and, estimate cost and time.  
SDLC consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software.  
Some of the stages of SDLC : Planning> Defining > Designing > Building > Testing > Deployment.  

**Planning and Requirement Analysis**    
It is the fundamental stage of SDLC.  
By analyzing the needs, planning is done by selecting technologies and approaches to create highest quality software with minimum risk.    

**Defining Requirements**  
In this step the product is clearly defined and documented.  
This is done through Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed.    

**Designing The Product Architecture**  
Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and,
documented in a Design Document Specification(DDS).  

This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness,
design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.  

**Building or Developing the Product**  
The software is generated as per DDS during this stage.  
Coding guideliness are followed by teams that are working on the project.  

**Testing the Product**  
The testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC.  
This stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested,
until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.  

**Deployment**  
Once the product is ready to be deployed it is released.  
Sometimes product released by stages or released in a limited segment and tested in real but limited environment (e.g beta testing).  

Then based on the feedback, the product may be get suggested enhancements.  
After the release, maintenance (enhancing or fixing by changes) is done for the existing customer base.  

**SDLC Models**  
Some of the most popular sdlc models: Waterfall, iterative, spiral, v-model, bigbang, agile, RAD.  

**Waterfall**  
**Iterative**  
**Spiral**  
**V-Model**  
**BigBang**  
**Agile**  
**RAD**
